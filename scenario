You have been hired as a security consultant for CompanyXYZ.

Your job is to secure this Ubuntu 14.04 computer.

Company policy specifies that all user accounts must be password protected.
The company strictly forbids any media files and "hacking tools" on any company
computer.

This computer is to be used as an SSH access point into our network, so any
authorized user should be able to log in remotely. We would also like to host
our website on this computer, although it is unfinished at the moment.

Required Services:
    sshd
    apache2

root pass = root
Authorized Administrators:
    leon      pass = defsecisfuntoo (This is you!)
    jack      pass = jack
    NOTE: "scoringengine" should remain untouched!!!

Authorized Users:
    tyler
    alex
    connor
    andrew

Do not touch, look at, think about touching or looking at, or do anything at
all to the directory, or any files within the directory /opt/Scoring-Engine.

You will find your score report on the desktop of "leon" (you). It is an HTML
document will be updated every ten seconds (you need to refresh the page).

There are 10 vulnerabilities. Note that there are probably more, but not all
will be scored. Don't think too hard :)
